## About

\
I’ve been writing HTML since the 90’s, CSS since the 00’s, and JavaScript since the 10’s. I’ve kept pace with the tools and frameworks of the modern web and love building great-looking, responsive and reactive, full stack applications.

### Teaching / Tutoring

As a bootcamp grad myself, it's great when I can help others learn code and get started in the industry. I’ve been a teaching assistant and lead instructor for full stack JavaScript bootcamps and University of Washington’s Continuum College for continuing education.  
\
I provide one-on-one tutoring to students of front-end web development. If you are looking for help navigating all the new ideas and nuances of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, [get in touch](mailto:kphyde@gmail.com)!
