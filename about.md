## About

\
I’ve been writing HTML since the 90’s, CSS since the 00’s, and JavaScript since the 10’s. I’ve kept pace with the tools and frameworks of the modern web and love building great-looking, responsive and reactive, full stack applications.

### Skilled Value

My specialty is being a strong link between design thinking and code engineering. My unique value comes from knowing the language and values of design teams, product developers, and the users they deliver to, and engineering the code that makes them real. My years experience with Semantic HTML, advanced CSS, and myriad JavaScript tools help me move fluidly from ideas to implementations. My empathy for stakeholders at every level helps make happy developers, designers, product managers, and users.

### Interests

A designer at heart, I am perpetually curious and exploring new ideas, and creative projects. Currently I'm digging deeply into blockchain technology, smart contract development, and DApp UX.  
\
I'm also a musician, veggie gardener, and graphic artist.

### Teaching / Tutoring

I'm a code bootcamp grad and career-changer, so I like to help others learn code and get started in the industry. I’ve been a teaching assistant and lead instructor for full-stack JavaScript bootcamps and University of Washington’s Continuum College for continuing education.  
\
I provide one-on-one tutoring to students of front-end web development. If you are looking for help navigating all the new ideas and nuances of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, [get in touch](mailto:kphyde@gmail.com)!
