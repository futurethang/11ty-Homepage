## Building the Next Web
  
\
I am a UX Engineer that builds innovative cloud-based enterprise software using the latest front-end technologies.  
\
I'm passionate about Web 3.0 and the future of Decentralized Application building. With a combination of UX Design, Engineering, and Smart Contract development skills, my goal is to be a builder of the Web's next generation, better for users and better for the world.  
\
I'm an advocate for wider adoption of the Web Component standard in building modern front ends, with help from awesome projects like [Lit](https://lit.dev/).
